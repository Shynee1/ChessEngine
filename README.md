# ChessEngine

- This is a simple Chess engine built in Java.
- All rendering/input handling is done with LibGDX.
- All underlying Chess code (pieces, moves, move generation) is custom coded by me. 
- It features a NegaMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, move ordering, transposition tables, zobrist hashing, and other various optimizations.
- It also includes functions for endgames and book openings.
